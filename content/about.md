Hi there, thanks for checking out my webpage. You know my name already :smile: . I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at University of Southern California working under supervision of Prof. Massoud Pedram ([SPORT Lab](http://www.mpedram.com/)) and Prof.  Peter A. Beerel ([HAL@usc](https://hal.usc.edu/)) . I was born in India and did my B.Tech and M.Tech in Electronics Engineering from West Bengal University of Technology and Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, respectively. My technical interest includes hardware friendly Computer vision, hardware accelerator architecture design for neural networks, in/near memory computing, computer  architecture.
