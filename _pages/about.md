* Hi there, thanks for dropping by my web. You know my name already :). I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at University of Southern California working under supervision of Prof. [Massoud Pedram](http://www.mpedram.com/) and Prof.  [Peter A. Beerel](https://hal.usc.edu/) . I was born in India and did my B.Tech and M.Tech in Electronics Engineering from West Bengal University of Technology and [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://iitkgp.ac.in/),  respectively. 
* My technical interest includes hardware friendly Computer vision, hardware accelerator architecture design for neural networks, In/near memory computing, computer  architecture. Apart from all these catchy words I love long drive along pacific highway, traveling, playing and watching soccer.
